### Game Flow
Player will be placed at a random location in an infinite world. The player must find and scavenge for resources from “Crashed Spaceships.” The ships are generated randomly around the map. The Payer has to conserve their own resources as Fuel is scarce. Fuel can be bought from Recharge Stations using Currency. This fuel lets the player travel to find more resources.

As an alternative source of resources, the player can also hunt down other players and take them on in battle. The losing ship will be destroyed to collect its resources.

### Look and Feel
Lunar Lander has a distinctive art style blending traditional Sprite work with sleek and modern line art. The look of the terrain is inspired by 1980s arcade games that used vector graphics while the Sprite work is drawn from retro games from the 80s and 90s mainly those on the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Super Nintendo.
